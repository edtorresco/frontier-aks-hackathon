## Azure Requirements

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Owner on the subscription (required for `--attach-acr`, RBAC assignments) |
| **Region** | `eastus` or `eastus2` recommended (best service availability) |
| **vCPU quota** | ~16 Standard D-series vCPUs per team (D4ds_v5 × 4 nodes minimum) |
| **GPU quota** *(AI track)* | `Standard_NC4as_T4_v3` — must request 24–48 hours in advance |
| **Resource providers** | `Microsoft.ContainerService`, `Microsoft.Monitor`, `Microsoft.Dashboard`, `Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`, `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry` |

Resource providers to pre-register:
```bash
for ns in Microsoft.ContainerService Microsoft.Monitor Microsoft.Dashboard \
           Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Microsoft.ContainerRegistry; do
  az provider register --namespace $ns
done
```

## Suggested Agenda

### Full 3-Day Event (Recommended)

| Day | Time | Challenges | Focus |
|-----|------|-----------|-------|
| Day 1 | AM | Ch 00–01 | Prerequisites, Containers & ACR |
| Day 1 | PM | Ch 02–04 | Cluster Deployment, App Deploy & Helm, Workload Identity |
| Day 2 | AM | Ch 05–07 | Observability, Autoscaling, GitOps |
| Day 2 | PM | Ch 08–09 | Security Hardening, Service Mesh (Istio) |
| Day 3 | AM | Ch 10–12 | Stateful Workloads, Enterprise Networking, Fleet Manager |
| Day 3 | PM | Ch 13, AI-01, AI-02 | FinOps *(optional)*, GPU / KAITO *(optional)* |

> **Tip:** Teams finishing early on Day 2 PM can start Ch 10 or the AI track.

### Focused 2-Day Event

| Day | Challenges | Focus |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Day 1 AM | Ch 00–02 | Setup, Containers, Cluster |
| Day 1 PM | Ch 03–06 | App Deployment, Identity, Observability, Autoscaling |
| Day 2 AM | Ch 07–09 | GitOps, Security, Service Mesh |
| Day 2 PM | Ch 10–12 | Storage, Networking, Fleet |
| Day 2 PM (optional) | AI-01, AI-02 | GPU, KAITO — for teams that finish early |

### Focused 1-Day Event

Challenges 00–08 cover the core AKS lifecycle. Challenges 09–12 are recommended for
teams with strong Kubernetes experience.

## Coaching Philosophy

1. **Don't give away answers.** When a team is stuck, ask guiding questions:
   - "What does `kubectl describe` tell you about that pod?"
   - "Have you checked the Azure Policy assignment status?"
   - "Is the namespace label set correctly for sidecar injection?"

2. **Use the solution files for yourself, not for participants.** Show CLI output
   and error messages — not the commands to fix them — unless a team is truly blocked
   and time is running out.

3. **Let teams choose their path.** AKS Automatic vs Standard in Ch 02, PostgreSQL
   managed vs in-cluster in Ch 03, NAT Gateway vs Firewall in Ch 11 — both paths
   are valid. The solution files cover the primary path; coaches decide when to steer.

4. **Timebox each challenge.** Suggested max times:
   - Ch 00: 30 min | Ch 01–02: 45 min each | Ch 03–06: 60 min each
   - Ch 07–12: 45–60 min each | AI-01–02: 60 min each

5. **The AI track is optional.** GPU quota issues should not block the core track.
   Teams without GPU quota can read the challenge and discuss the concepts.

## Student Resources

Provide participants with a `Resources.zip` containing the FabTechOps source code
(Dockerfiles, app code, and sample manifests). If teams run into build issues, the
pre-built public images on Docker Hub can be imported directly into their ACR as a fallback:

- `docker.io/whatthehackmsft/api:latest` → `fabtech-api:v1`
- `docker.io/whatthehackmsft/web:latest` → `fabtech-web:v1`

---

## Cleanup

Remind all teams to delete resources at the end:

```bash
az group delete --name rg-frontier-aks --no-wait --yes
```
