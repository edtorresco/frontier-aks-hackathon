## Azure Requirements

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Owner on the subscription (required for `--attach-acr`, RBAC assignments) |
| **Region** | `swedencentral` recommended (best service availability) |
| **vCPU quota** | ~16 Standard D-series vCPUs per team (D4ds_v5 × 4 nodes minimum) |
| **GPU quota** *(AI track)* | `Standard_NC4as_T4_v3` — must request 24–48 hours in advance |
| **Resource providers** | `Microsoft.ContainerService`, `Microsoft.Monitor`, `Microsoft.Dashboard`, `Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration`, `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry` |

Resource providers to pre-register:
```bash
for ns in Microsoft.ContainerService Microsoft.Monitor Microsoft.Dashboard \
           Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration Microsoft.ContainerRegistry; do
  az provider register --namespace $ns
done
```

> **Tip:** Teams finishing early on Day 2 PM can start Ch 10 or the AI track.

### Focused 2-Day Event

| Day | Challenges | Focus |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Day 1 AM | Ch 00–02 | Setup, Containers, Cluster |
| Day 1 PM | Ch 03–06 | App Deployment, Identity, Observability, Autoscaling |
| Day 2 AM | Ch 07–09 | GitOps, Security, Service Mesh |
| Day 2 PM | Ch 10–12 | Storage, Networking, Fleet |
| Day 2 PM (optional) | AI-01, AI-02 | GPU, KAITO — for teams that finish early |

### Focused 1-Day Event

Challenges 00–08 cover the core AKS lifecycle. Challenges 09–12 are recommended for
teams with strong Kubernetes experience.

## Coaching Philosophy

1. **Don't give away answers.** When a team is stuck, ask guiding questions:
   - "What does `kubectl describe` tell you about that pod?"
   - "Have you checked the Azure Policy assignment status?"
   - "Is the namespace label set correctly for sidecar injection?"

2. **Use the solution files for yourself, not for participants.** Show CLI output
   and error messages — not the commands to fix them — unless a team is truly blocked
   and time is running out.

3. **Let teams choose their path.** AKS Automatic vs Standard in Ch 02, PostgreSQL
   managed vs in-cluster in Ch 03, NAT Gateway vs Firewall in Ch 11 — both paths
   are valid. The solution files cover the primary path; coaches decide when to steer.

4. **Timebox each challenge.** Suggested max times:
   - Ch 00: 30 min | Ch 01–02: 45 min each | Ch 03–06: 60 min each
   - Ch 07–12: 45–60 min each | AI-01–02: 60 min each

5. **The AI track is optional.** GPU quota issues should not block the core track.
   Teams without GPU quota can read the challenge and discuss the concepts.

## Per-Challenge Coach Guide

Use this table as your quick reference during the event. Each row links to the detailed
solution file. The "When to intervene" column is a suggestion — trust your read of the room.

| Ch | Title | Key Concepts to Introduce | Known Blockers & Hints | Est. Time | When to Intervene |
|----|-------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 00 | Prerequisites | Cloud-native toolchain; Azure resource providers | WSL1 vs WSL2; missing `kubelogin`; unregistered providers | 30 min | After 20 min if still installing tools |
| 01 | Containers & ACR | Docker layering; ACR Tasks; managed identity auth | `az acr login` token expiry; ACR SKU must be ≥ Standard for Workload Identity | 45 min | If images fail to push after 30 min |
| 02 | AKS Cluster Deployment | Azure CNI Overlay; Workload Identity; availability zones | Quota exceeded (request increase ahead of time); `--enable-oidc-issuer` required for WI | 45 min | If cluster stuck Provisioning > 20 min |
| 03 | App Deployment & Gateway API | Helm chart structure; App Routing add-on; Gateway API routing | Helm values file versus `--set`; verify GatewayClass exists before applying Gateway | 60 min | After 45 min if app not accessible |
| 04 | Workload Identity & Secrets | Federated credentials; UAMI; Secrets Store CSI | Namespace of service account must match federated credential; CSI driver pod must be Running | 60 min | After 40 min on federated credential config |
| 05 | Observability | Managed Prometheus scrape config; Container Insights; Grafana | DCR must be linked to cluster; Grafana datasource must point to correct workspace | 60 min | After 40 min if no metrics appear |
| 06 | Autoscaling | HPA vs KEDA; Karpenter / NAP; VPA | KEDA ScaledObject must reference correct deployment; NAP/Karpenter requires cluster created in Ch 02 with `--node-provisioning-mode Auto`, `--network-dataplane cilium`, and `--network-plugin-mode overlay` — verify with `az aks show --query agentPoolProfiles[].nodeProvisioningMode` | 60 min | After 50 min if nodes not provisioning |
| 07 | GitOps with Flux v2 | GitRepository; Kustomization; source vs reconcile | PAT token scopes; Flux needs write access for image automation; `flux reconcile` is your friend | 60 min | After 40 min if Kustomization stuck |
| 08 | AKS Security | Entra RBAC; Azure Policy / OPA Gatekeeper; Defender | Allow 15–20 min for Gatekeeper to sync and enforce policy; Defender plan must be enabled at subscription level | 60 min | After 45 min on policy assignment |
| 09 | Istio Service Mesh | mTLS PeerAuthentication; VirtualService; sidecar injection | Namespace label `istio.io/rev` must match revision; wait for sidecar containers before testing | 60 min | After 40 min if traffic routing broken |
| 10 | Persistent Storage | StorageClass; PVC dynamic provisioning; Azure Disk vs Files | RWX access mode requires Azure Files; disk PVCs are RWO only | 45 min | After 30 min if PVC stuck Pending |
| 11 | Enterprise Networking | Private API server; Cilium network policies; NAT Gateway vs Firewall | Private cluster requires VNet peering or VPN to access API server; egress UDR + Firewall rules | 60 min | After 45 min on network policy |
| 12 | AKS Fleet Manager | Fleet hub; member clusters; cluster propagation | Fleet requires separate hub cluster resource; propagation rules use label selectors | 45 min | After 30 min if member join fails |
| 13 *(opt)* | FinOps & Cost Management | Cost Analysis add-on; spot toleration; resource requests | Cost Analysis requires Standard/Premium tier; spot nodes need both taint toleration and node selector | 45 min | After 30 min if spot pod not scheduling |
| AI-01 *(opt)* | GPU Foundations | GPU node pool; NVIDIA device plugin; nvidia-smi | GPU quota must be requested 24–48 h in advance; device plugin DaemonSet must be Running | 60 min | If no GPU nodes after 20 min |
| AI-02 *(opt)* | LLM Inference with KAITO | KAITO workspace CRD; model preset; inference endpoint | First workspace creation triggers GPU node provisioning (~10 min); model download can take 5–15 min | 60 min | After 40 min if workspace not Ready |

## Cleanup

Remind all teams to delete resources at the end:

```bash
az group delete --name rg-frontier-aks --no-wait --yes
```
