# Frontier AKS Hackathon

## Introduction

This expert-level hack takes you through the full lifecycle of running a production-grade
application on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** using current best practices.

You will start from zero — containerizing an application, deploying an AKS cluster, and
progressively hardening, scaling, observing, and operating it.

By the end of the hack you will have hands-on experience with:

- AKS Automatic and Standard cluster modes
- Workload Identity (Entra ID federated credentials)
- Azure Managed Prometheus and Grafana
- KEDA event-driven autoscaling + Karpenter node provisioning
- GitOps with Flux v2 via the AKS Flux extension
- AKS managed Istio service mesh
- Azure Policy for Kubernetes (OPA Gatekeeper)
- AKS Fleet Manager for multi-cluster operations
- *(Optional)* AI inference on AKS with KAITO

## Learning Objectives

1. Deploy and configure a production-ready AKS cluster with Azure CNI Overlay and Workload Identity
2. Package and deliver applications using Helm and the App Routing ingress add-on
3. Eliminate secret sprawl with Azure Key Vault and the Secrets Store CSI driver
4. Achieve full-stack observability with Managed Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry
5. Build resilient, auto-scaling workloads using HPA, VPA, KEDA, and Karpenter
6. Implement GitOps continuous delivery with Flux v2
7. Harden cluster security using Entra RBAC, Azure Policy, and Microsoft Defender for Containers
8. Manage traffic and secure service-to-service communication with AKS managed Istio
9. Operate a fleet of clusters with AKS Fleet Manager

## Sample Application

**FabTechOps** is a three-tier web application used throughout this hack:

| Tier | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Frontend | [`Student/Resources/src/content-web`](./Student/Resources/src/content-web/) | React-based conference info site |
| API | [`Student/Resources/src/content-api`](./Student/Resources/src/content-api/) | Node.js REST API (serves JSON data; connects to PostgreSQL if `DATABASE_URL` is set) |
| Database | `docker pull postgres:16` | PostgreSQL database |
